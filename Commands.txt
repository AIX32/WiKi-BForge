Non-working Commands

Some commands are either disabled or non-functional in certain game modes.

/home in Murder Mystery
The /home command does not work in Murder Mystery mode. Attempting to use it will display an error message. This is likely a glitch since homes aren't supported in Murder Mystery.

/hide in Evil Tower and Bloxd Hop
The /hide command does not work in these modes. Players should use the [F] key instead.

Ping in Plots
The "ping" command is listed but does not function in Plots. A message will prompt users to try using the "ping [message]" command, but this feature is non-functional.
