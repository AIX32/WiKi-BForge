Arthur's Clever Dev-Selecting Mechanic

Arthur has a unique method for selecting new developers for Bloxd.io. According to leaked information by Dirty Flea Sack, new developers must first create a gamemode that is added as a temporary Limited Time Mode (LMT). The feedback from players is observed, and if successful, the developer then creates another gamemode that gets put to a vote. If it receives positive feedback, the developer is officially added to the team.

2. Weiqing
Weiqing was the initial developer of Bloxd Hop, the first publicly available game built using the Bloxd.io engine. Although Arthur originally created the game engine, Weiqing contributed to the creation of Bloxd Hop, and later, Arthur took over its development.
