BedWars
Creator: Arthur
Description: Destroy your enemies' beds to win!

BedWars is a team-based PvP (Player versus Player) game mode on Bloxd.io, where players battle to destroy each other's beds while protecting their own. The game takes place on islands suspended in the sky, where players must strategically defend their beds and eliminate their opponents. The goal is to break the enemy teams' beds, preventing them from respawning. Players who die after their bed is destroyed are permanently eliminated from the game.


Diamond Island

Diamond Island (also known as Mid) is the central island on most maps and contains Diamond generators. In maps like Wood Factory, there are multiple Diamond Islands, each with its own generator.

Buffs
Recent updates include changes to maps, added NPCs (or sellers), discounts on some items, and the introduction of new Lucky Items.

Duos
Duos is a mode where players are grouped into teams of two. You and your teammate work together to protect your bed and eliminate the other teams. There are eight teams in total.

Solos
Solos is a sub-game mode where each player is on their own, facing off against other solo players. This mode offers a more challenging experience, as you cannot rely on teammates.

Squads
Squads (formerly called 4v4v4v4) is a mode where players are grouped into teams of four. Teamwork is crucial for success, and players must cooperate to protect their beds and eliminate opponents.

Beds
Each team has a bed in their base, which must be protected. Once an enemy breaks your bed, you can still respawn, but after you die once, you are eliminated. Beds can be destroyed by various methods, except with Moonstone Explosives.

Generators
Generators are blocks that produce resources like Coal, Iron, Moonstone, and Diamonds. Moonstone and Diamond generators upgrade over time and cause beds to be destroyed when they reach their final stage.

Main Generators
Each team's base has a generator that produces Coal and Iron, which can be used to purchase blocks and items.

Moonstone and Diamond Generators
These generators spawn on islands around the map, producing Moonstone and Diamonds. They upgrade over time and increase in efficiency.

Shop
Players can purchase items using resources gathered from generators. Items include blocks, weapons, armor, and utilities. There are also Lucky Items, which are introduced periodically and can be found in special events.

Losing Items when Dying
Upon death, players lose the items in their inventory, but certain items, like armor and upgraded tools, are retained.

Chests
Normal Chest
Each base contains a normal chest, which can only be accessed by the team in whose base it resides. This chest is used to store items that can be shared among team members.

Moonstone Chest
This chest stores resources and items, which remain accessible after death. It can be used to store valuable materials like Moonstone and Diamonds.

Strategies with Moonstone Chest
Players can use the Moonstone Chest to safeguard their resources in case of an attack or when planning a strategic assault.

NPC (or Seller)
Introduced in October 2024, the NPC seller provides an alternative way to access items instead of the traditional shop menu.
