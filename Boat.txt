Usage
Boats are used primarily for the transportation of players across water and ice.

Transportation
Boats allow movement over water, land, and ice.

Entering or Exiting
PC: Right-click the boat to enter or exit it.
Mobile: Tap the boat to enter or exit it.
Additionally, you can exit the boat by crouching.

Movement of the Boat
PC: Control the boat using WASD or the arrow keys. To steer the boat, point the mouse in the desired direction.
Mobile: Boat movement and control are similar to the PC version.

More info

If you do not exit the boat before teleporting, the boat will teleport with you.
Boats can only be placed on water blocks. They can be moved onto land using teleportation, but will travel at a slower speed.
Ice speeds up boats, sometimes causing them to go so fast that it interferes with anti-cheat systems, causing frequent slowdowns.
Hitting a player sitting in a boat on water will cause them to experience more knockback than usual, which can also confuse the anti-cheat.
Boats can sometimes phase through walls due to glitches (see Glitches for more details).
If you die from void damage while in a boat, the boat will separate from you, fall a short distance, then bounce as if there was a bouncy material in the void before disappearing.
Holding a Hang Glider or crouching while in a boat will eject you from the boat.
When in a boat, a player will receive an effect called "Boating" with no set duration.
